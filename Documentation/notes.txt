node
	simple data gathering system with three data commands and two protocol commands
	commands
		get temp
			gets temperuature celsuis
		get humi
			gets humidity (unknown units)
		get lumi
			gets a relitive value of light for refrence purposes
		ack
			acknolegd command sent for when data is recieved sucessfully
		nack
			not acknoleged sent when parity has faild or the command has returned an unexptected result
	difficulties
		the dht11 fails to record temperatures below 0
			fix: add lm35 for use with sub zero temperatures
			since the lm35 is roughly proportional to the dht11 with the only draw back being the 
			resolution we are able to find the approximate value by using the dht11 to configure the lm35 multiplier and offset
		case was made with little room for new shield
			fix: the 3d printed case we mmade didnt have quite enougth room for the shield so we drilled some holes for the headers
		memory over flows
			fix: we found refrence material to find the number of free bits of memory in the arduino and made leaky functions aware 
			of this so that they wouldnt overflow the memory
